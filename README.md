# nii_preview
A simple utility to visualize 3D NIFTI image based on Python3.

## How to install
**all you need is the "nll_preview.py" located in this repo.**
but also, you need to install the following Python packages (ignore if you already installed):
> 1) **matplotlib** (any version should work)
> 2) **numpy** (any version should work)
> 3) **nibabel** (used for loading "\*.nii" or "\*.nii.gz" files, recommend version >=3.2.1, but lower version is OK I guess)

## How to use
here is an example of how to use it
